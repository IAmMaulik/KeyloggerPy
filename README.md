# Keylogger Program

#### This is a brilliant program that I made in python.
#### It is a keylogger which tracks all the letters/commands typed by the user.

## Modules Used
- os
- logging
- shutil
- pynput

All the modules above except pynput are standard modules that come with python

## Steps to use this keylogger
- Type this command in terminal if you have git installed 
  ```git clone https://github.com/IAmMaulik/Keylogger_Program.git```
- Type this command in your terminal
	```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Run the program by writing ```python main.py```


## Point to note
- This works only on Windows 7 and Windows 10 (I don't have Windows 8, so I do not know about that)
- To use for Windows 7, Use the latest version of the file
- For windows 10, use the earlier version of the file

#### I have made this program such that it opens directly upons startup of computer
#### You can very easily edit the file so that it runs in the background, but I am not doing because I do not want to give some person a readymade spyware software.


### I am not responsible for any of the illegal activities that you can by using this program. Use at your own risk
### Stealing passwords is NOT cool
