# Keylogger Program

This is a brilliant program that I made in python.
It is a keylogger which tracks all the letters/commands typed by the user.
as well as takes screenshots and also captures audio and sends it all to the attacker every 10 seconds. It is an extremely dangerous software.
I have also compiled it into a .exe file so that it runs on computers that do not have python installed as well
